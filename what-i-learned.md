# What I've Learned Week

## Functions

This week we learned how to create a set of rules within Javasctipt. We're able to designate a key word to perform an action on the given data. 

## Booleans

We also learned how to give certain rules to data to find out what is a certain value that the user is looking for.

## Methods

We learned how to manipulate strings using methods. These attributes are used tell a given item to be modified by saved commands. *For example*:

var x = 'hello'
x.toUppercase will capitalize all the letteris in that string.

## Indexes

Indexes are deal with the placement of characters in a string and what their value is. You can use indexes to find what characters are where and manipulate strings.
